  abstract = {We give an overview of recent developments in the theory of dimer models. The viewpoint we take is inspired by mirror symmetry. After an introduction to the combinatorics of dimer models, we will first look at dimers in dynamical systems and statistical mechanics, which can be viewed as coming from the A-model in mirror symmetry. Then we will discuss the role of dimers in the theory of resolutions of singularities, which is inspired by the B-model. The C stands for the connections that tie both subjects together: clusters, categories, and stability conditions. In this final part we will give some ideas on how these two stories fit in a broader framework.},

  abstract = {We study quivers with relations given by non-commutative analogs of Jacobian ideals in the complete path algebra. This framework allows us to give a representation-theoretic interpretation of quiver mutations at arbitrary vertices. This gives a far-reaching generalization of Bernstein-Gelfand-Ponomarev reflection functors. The motivations for this work come from several sources: superpotentials in physics, Calabi-Yau algebras, cluster algebras.},

In particular, we show that the underlying cluster complex of such a cluster algebra does not depend on the choice of coefficients, describe this complex explicitly in terms of "tagged triangulations" of the surface, and determine its homotopy type and its growth rate.},
